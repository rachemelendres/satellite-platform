# AppEARS

The Application for Extracting and Exploring Analysis Ready Samples ([AρρEEARS](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/tools/appeears/)) is a developed by LP DAAC NASA that offers users a simple and efficient way to perform data access and transformation processes. Data can be requested in two ways: point samples of geographic coordinates or area samples of vector polygons. 

* ## Point

Input coordinates of point of interest
